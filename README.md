## ## Key Features

This portfolio is more than just a static page. It includes several advanced features to create a memorable user experience:

* **Modern & Responsive Design**: The layout is fluid and looks great on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.
* **Dark/Light Theme**: A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes. Their preference is automatically saved in their browser for future visits.
* **Interactive UI**:
    * **Unique Blob Cursor**: A soft, gradient "blob" follows the mouse and interacts with links and buttons.
    * **Glassmorphism Header**: The navigation bar has a "frosted glass" effect that blurs the content behind it as you scroll.
    * **Smooth Scroll Animations**: Sections gracefully fade into view as they enter the viewport.
* **Dynamic Elements**: Includes a "Back to Top" button for easy navigation and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
